NXTuino-
========

Balancing robot consist of Arduino UNO and two NXT motors with Encoder. 


This Balancig robot is result of my meeting with MPU6050 and nxt motors. I used allready written library I2CDevlib which helps me to read Pitch, Roll and Yaw. 
I made also the GUI for easyer manipulation with Constants P,I,D and debuging what arduino says. 

This all code is free and you can use him for your own projects! ENJOY!
